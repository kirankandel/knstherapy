# Session Request Flow Implementation

## ✅ Complete Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented the full session request flow between clients and therapists. Here's what was accomplished:

### **User Flow (Anonymous Session)**
1. **User selects therapist** from available therapist list
2. **Session request sent** to specific therapist via Socket.IO
3. **Real-time feedback** shows request status (pending, sent, declined, accepted)
4. **User gets notified** when therapist accepts or declines
5. **Chat starts immediately** upon acceptance

### **Therapist Flow (Dashboard)**
1. **Receives session requests** in real-time on the dashboard
2. **Can accept or decline** each request with a reason
3. **Automatically starts chat session** when accepting
4. **Request management** with proper UI feedback

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend Changes:**

#### **1. useSocket Hook** (`/frontend/src/hooks/useSocket.js`)
- ✅ Added `requestSession(therapistId, sessionType, message, preferences)`
- ✅ Added `acceptRequest(requestId)` and `declineRequest(requestId, reason)`
- ✅ Added session request event listeners:
  - `onSessionRequest` - Therapist receives incoming requests
  - `onRequestSent` - User gets confirmation request was sent
  - `onRequestFailed` - User notified if request failed
  - `onRequestDeclined` - User notified if therapist declined
- ✅ Enhanced connection error handling with helpful backend startup instructions
- ✅ Added backend health check before socket connection

#### **2. Anonymous Session Page** (`/frontend/src/app/anonymous-session/page.js`)
- ✅ Updated therapist selection to use session request flow
- ✅ Added request status tracking and UI feedback
- ✅ Enhanced waiting states with proper status messages
- ✅ Added cancel request functionality
- ✅ Added "Try Another Therapist" option when declined
- ✅ Connection test functionality with backend startup guide

#### **3. Therapist Dashboard** (`/frontend/src/app/therapist-dashboard/page.js`)
- ✅ Added session request event handling
- ✅ Real-time pending requests display
- ✅ Accept/decline request functionality
- ✅ Automatic session setup upon acceptance
- ✅ Proper request state management

#### **4. SessionRequestCard Component** (`/frontend/src/components/SessionRequestCard.js`)
- ✅ Updated to handle `sessionType` from backend
- ✅ Proper accept/decline button integration
- ✅ Request details display with timestamp

### **Backend Integration:**
The backend already had complete session request handlers:
- ✅ `request-session` - Handles incoming session requests
- ✅ `accept-request` - Processes therapist acceptance
- ✅ `decline-request` - Processes therapist decline
- ✅ Real-time notifications to both parties
- ✅ Session matching and room creation

## 🚀 **How to Test the Complete Flow**

### **1. Start Backend Server:**
```bash
cd /Users/kirankandel/Documents/knstherapy/backend
node src/index.js
```
*You should see: "Connected to MongoDB" and "Listening to port 3001"*

### **2. Test User Flow:**
1. Open frontend → Navigate to "Anonymous Session"
2. Click "Choose Your Therapist"
3. Select any available therapist
4. Watch the request being sent (should show "Waiting for [Therapist] to respond...")

### **3. Test Therapist Flow:**
1. Open therapist dashboard (need therapist login)
2. Go online to receive requests
3. You'll see incoming session requests in real-time
4. Click "Accept" or "Decline" to respond

### **4. Test Complete Session:**
1. When therapist accepts → Both parties enter chat
2. Real-time messaging works between user and therapist
3. Either party can end the session

## 🛠 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"xhr poll error"** - Backend not running
   - Solution: Start backend with `node src/index.js`

2. **"No therapists available"** - No therapists online
   - Solution: Have a therapist go online in their dashboard

3. **Request not appearing** - Socket connection issue
   - Solution: Check browser console for connection errors

### **Debug Features:**
- ✅ Connection test button in anonymous session
- ✅ Detailed error messages with backend startup instructions
- ✅ Real-time status indicators
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
